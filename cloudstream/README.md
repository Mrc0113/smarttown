# Smart Town Workshop

You have everything here to complete the workshop with the help of codelab [XX].

At the end of this exercise, you would have built microservices that demonstrates a smart town function of collecting IoT sensor data, monitoring device temperatures and generating alerts.

### Microservices

a) __IoT Simulator__ - A microservice to simulate IoT sensors, publishing temperature reading every second
b) __Alert Generator__ - A controller that subscribes to temperature readings and generate alerts with appropriate priority
